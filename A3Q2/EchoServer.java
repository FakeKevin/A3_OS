Assignment #3 - Question #2
Date Due: Nov. 5th, 2018
By: Jason Han & Keun Young Jee

Description:
Assignment 2, Question 1, involved designing an echo server using the Java threading
API. This server is single-threaded, meaning that the server cannot respond to
concurrent echo clients until the current client exits. Modify your solution to Assignment
2, Question 1, so that the echo server services each client in a separate request.

Input sanitizing - While it is always recommended to sanitize input, the fact that this
program will compile and execute any code it is sent over the Internet basically makes it
impossible to secure properly. Just do basic sanitizing and donâ€™t worry too much.
